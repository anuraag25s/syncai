# SyncAI — Replace Meetings with Async Alignment

SyncAI is an AI-powered async standup assistant that helps remote and distributed teams stay aligned **without daily meetings**.

Instead of sitting through low-signal standups, teams submit quick async updates. SyncAI structures them into clear digests, flags blockers, assigns owners, and highlights decisions — grounded in real work from Jira, GitHub, and Linear.

> Less meetings. Faster unblocking. Better alignment.

## Why SyncAI Exists

Daily standups are broken for modern teams:
- Expensive in time and attention
- Unfair across time zones
- Low signal for most attendees
- Poor at capturing blockers and ownership

Yet teams still need alignment.

SyncAI replaces the *meeting* — not the *outcome*.
